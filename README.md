Creating a Passcode Door Lock Using Digital Logic Design Concepts
In this project we will ask the user to enter a 4 digit passcode and check whether it is right or wrong. Depending on that we will give user the access or deny it.
Now as to explain how the code works:

First we have stored the correct passcode in a register as 4x4 matrix.
Next we ask the user to input the passcode and compare it with the original passcode one by one. We store the inputted passcode how we stored the original passcode i.e. using register in 4x4 matrix.
In case of correct passcode a message will pop up indicating that the passcode is correct and in case of incorrect passcode wrong passcode message will be shown. User will again get the chance to input a new passcode attempt.

You will also be given the option to change a passcode in case you need that availability.
For this you will just need to switch the command to change passcode from unlock door.

There will also be a status indicator displaying whether the door is locked or unlocked.
